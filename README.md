# QuantProjects

This repository contains projects and tools for quantitative finance, including derivatives pricing, portfolio optimization, and algorithmic trading.

## Features
- **Derivatives Pricing:** Implement vanilla and exotic options pricing under various models (e.g., Black-Scholes, Heston).
- **Portfolio Optimization:** Build tools for mean-variance optimization, risk metrics (VaR, CVaR), and rebalancing.
- **Algorithmic Trading:** Backtesting and live trading strategies with APIs like Alpaca or Interactive Brokers.
- **Interactive Tools:** Front-end dashboards for pricing, data visualization, and performance analytics (e.g., using Streamlit).

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1:** Build a pricing library for vanilla options (Black-Scholes, Greeks, implied vol).
- **Phase 2:** Add Monte Carlo simulations for exotic options (Asian, barrier).
- **Phase 3:** Create a Streamlit dashboard for interactive pricing and visualization.
